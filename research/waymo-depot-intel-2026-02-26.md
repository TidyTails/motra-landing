## Key Findings

### 1. Waymo Already Outsources Cleaning
**Direct quote from Business Insider:**
> "Employees **contracted by Transdev** and other third-party companies maintain Waymo's robotaxis."

**MOTRA Implication:** They're already using third-party contractors. MOTRA wouldn't be asking them to change behavior — just offering a better/specialized option.

---

### 2. Cleaning is Manual & Time-Critical

**From the article:**
> "The more time Waymos are spent in the lot, the less time they're being utilized and making money."

- Workers track "productive times" on whiteboards
- Tools meticulously organized (towels sorted by day of use)
- Efficiency directly impacts revenue

**MOTRA Angle:** Speed + quality = money saved. Mobile cleaning = less depot time.

### 3. Scale Numbers (SF Bay Area)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Robotaxis in SF | ~1,000 |
| Daily services at largest depot | Hundreds |
| Workers at one depot | 40+ |
| Depot operational | 5-6 years |

**MOTRA Implication:** This is just ONE market. Scale is real and growing.

---

### 4. Specific Depot Locations

| Address | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **201 Toland St, San Francisco** | Largest depot, Bayview neighborhood, mostly outdoor |
| **737 Harrison St, San Francisco** | Former Otto building (from Reddit) |

**MOTRA Action:** These are real addresses for outreach/observation.

---

### 5. User Hygiene Concerns (Forum Discussion)

**Real user conversation:**
> "My daughter took a Waymo while she had a bad cold..."
> 
> Response: "But the next customer would have been totally unaware of contaminated surfaces. **Human oversight might have led to surfaces being wiped down.** Automation is great, but w/o oversight... automation becomes just a cost saver."

**MOTRA Value Prop Validation:** 
- Between-ride sanitization is a real gap
- Users are aware of the hygiene risk
- Current system has no human oversight between rides

---

### 6. Competition Emerging

**From Business Insider:**
> "Some companies are building products or infrastructure entirely dedicated to **automating the servicing process**."

**MOTRA Implication:** Window is closing. First-mover advantage matters.

---

### 7. Depot Challenges

- Noise complaints from residents (Santa Monica sued Waymo)
- COVID restrictions shaped depot design (outdoor vs indoor)
- New vehicle platforms being tested (Hyundai IONIQ 5, Ojai/Zeekr)

---

## Competitor/Partner: Transdev

**Who they are:** Global transportation company, already contracted by Waymo for depot operations.

**Research needed:**
- What's Transdev's scope? (just depot or mobile too?)
- Are they a potential partner or competitor?
- What's their contract structure with Waymo?
