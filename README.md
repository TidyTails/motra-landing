# MOTRA

**Autonomy, Maintained.**

MOTRA is a mobile autonomy maintenance platform delivering infrastructure-level fleet care for autonomous vehicles at scale.

## The Problem

Autonomous vehicles operate 24/7 with no driver to notice issues between rides. As robotaxi fleets scale to millions of rides per week, traditional depot-based cleaning and maintenance can't keep up.

## The Solution

A gig-economy powered network of mobile technicians who service autonomous vehicles on-location, on-demand.

- **Between-ride cleaning** — 5-10 minute turnaround
- **Deep cleaning & detailing** — Daily/weekly
- **Sensor maintenance** — Critical for AV safety
- **Light maintenance** — Tire, fluids, lights
- **Emergency response** — Spills, biohazard, accidents

## Market Opportunity

- Waymo: 2,500+ vehicles, 400K rides/week, targeting 1M/week
- TAM (2028): $547M
- TAM (2032): $5.4B+
- Blue ocean — no scaled competitor exists
