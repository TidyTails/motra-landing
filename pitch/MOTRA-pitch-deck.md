# MOTRA Pitch Deck
## Autonomy, Maintained

---

# SLIDE 1: Company Purpose

## **MOTRA is the infrastructure layer for autonomous vehicle fleet care.**

We deploy a gig-powered network of mobile technicians to clean and service robotaxis on-location, on-demand — keeping fleets running 24/7 without depot downtime.

---

# SLIDE 2: The Problem

## Autonomous vehicles run 24/7. Their maintenance infrastructure doesn't.

**The Pain:**
- 🚗 **No driver = no eyes** — Nobody notices trash, spills, or wear between rides
- 📍 **Depot-dependent** — Vehicles must return to facilities for basic cleaning
- ⏱️ **Downtime = lost revenue** — Every minute in depot is a ride not taken
- 🔧 **Sensors are safety-critical** — Dirty LiDAR/cameras = degraded driving
- 📈 **Doesn't scale** — Fixed facilities can't keep up with distributed fleets

**Current Workarounds:**
- In-house depot operations (expensive, inflexible)
- Traditional car washes (can't use — damages sensors)
- Honor system for passenger messes (reactive, not proactive)

**Waymo hand-washes every vehicle. That doesn't scale to millions of rides.**

# SLIDE 3: The Solution

## Mobile fleet care, dispatched like an Uber.

**MOTRA deploys certified technicians directly to vehicles — wherever they are.**

| Service | Time | Use Case |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Quick Clean** | 5-10 min | Between-ride wipe-down, trash, odor |
| **Deep Clean** | 30-60 min | Full interior detail, sensors, exterior |
| **Light Maintenance** | Variable | Tires, fluids, lights, minor repairs |
| **Emergency Response** | ASAP | Spills, biohazard, accident support |

**The Result:**
- ✅ Vehicles stay in service zones (no depot trips)
- ✅ Variable cost (pay per service, not per facility)
- ✅ Scales with fleet growth instantly
- ✅ 24/7 availability

# SLIDE 4: Why Now?

## The robotaxi industry is hitting an inflection point.

| Trend | Data |
|-------|------|
| **Waymo scale** | 400K rides/week → targeting 1M/week by end of 2026 |
| **Fleet growth** | 2,500 vehicles today → "tens of thousands" planned |
| **New entrants** | Tesla Robotaxi, Zoox, Cruise rebuild — all scaling in 2026-2027 |
| **Gig infrastructure** | Uber/DoorDash proved the model — workforce is trained and ready |
| **Investor interest** | $100B+ invested in AV industry; support services underserved |

**The window:**
- AV companies are focused on driving tech, not cleaning ops
- No scaled competitor exists today
- First mover captures relationships before in-house becomes entrenched

**If we wait 2 years, AV companies will build it themselves or a competitor will emerge.**

# SLIDE 5: Market Size

## $500M+ market emerging, scaling to $5B+

**TAM Calculation:**

| Timeframe | AVs Operating | Services/Day | Price/Service | Annual TAM |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| **2028** | 50,000 | 2 | $15 | **$547M** |
| **2030** | 200,000 | 2 | $15 | **$2.2B** |
| **2032** | 500,000 | 2 | $15 | **$5.5B** |

**SAM (Serviceable):**
- Focus on top 5 AV operators in top 10 US markets
- Year 1: $20M opportunity (Waymo SF + Phoenix)

**SOM (Obtainable Year 1):**
- Target: 10% of one operator's fleet in one city
- ~$2M ARR

**Expansion vectors:**
- Electric fleet services (Amazon, FedEx, UPS vans)
- International AV markets (China, Europe)
- Adjacent services (charging coordination, parts supply)

# SLIDE 6: Competition

## Blue ocean with fragmented alternatives.

| Player | Approach | Gap |
|--------|----------|-----|
| **AV In-House Ops** | Depot-based cleaning | High fixed cost, doesn't scale |
| **Traditional Fleet Services** | Fixed locations | Not mobile, not AV-specialized |
| **Car Washes** | Automated cleaning | Can't handle sensors, no interior |
| **Mobile Detailing** | On-demand cleaning | Not scaled, not fleet-focused |
| **Gig Platforms** | General labor | No AV specialization or training |

**Our Advantages:**

1. **AV-Specialized** — Sensor cleaning, EV charging coordination, safety protocols
2. **Mobile-First** — Go to the vehicle, not the other way around
3. **Gig-Powered** — Variable cost, instant scaling, geographic flexibility
4. **Tech-Enabled** — API integration with fleet management systems
5. **First Mover** — No scaled competitor; relationships compound

# SLIDE 8: Business Model

## Platform take-rate on every service.

**Revenue Model:**
- MOTRA charges fleet operators per service
- MOTRA pays technicians per job
- **Platform margin: 25-35%**

**Unit Economics:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Avg service price | $15 |
| Tech payout | $10-11 |
| MOTRA margin | $4-5 (27-33%) |
| Services/tech/day | 15-20 |
| Tech daily earnings | $150-220 |

**At Scale:**
- 1,000 services/day = $15K revenue, $4-5K margin
- 10,000 services/day = $150K revenue, $40-50K margin
- **High operating leverage** — platform costs don't scale linearly

**Pricing Tiers:**
- Quick Clean: $12-18
- Deep Clean: $45-75
- Emergency: $75-150 (premium)
- Enterprise contracts: Volume discounts + SLAs
